# Playwright E2E Test SauceDemo
This project includes a thorough end-to-end (E2E) test suite for the SauceDemo application, which was developed with TypeScript and Playwright. To guarantee a scalable, maintainable, and supportive architecture, the test suite is created using fixtures, utility functions, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
